Global layout :

It is organised into three class :

- cell : representing a cell with a couple of attributes

Install :
---------

To manage properly the dependency we will set up a virtualenvironement

Improvements (TODO) :
---------------------

* let the user choose the size and the number of mines

* adding sound
